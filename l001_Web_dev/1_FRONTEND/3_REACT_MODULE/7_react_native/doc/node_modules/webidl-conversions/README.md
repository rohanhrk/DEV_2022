# Web IDL Type Conversions on JavaScript Values

This package implements, in JavaScript, the algorithms to convert a given JavaScript value according to a given [Web IDL](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/) [type](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-types).

The goal is that you should be able to write code like

```js
"use strict";
const conversions = require("webidl-conversions");

function doStuff(x, y) {
    x = conversions["boolean"](x);
    y = conversions["unsigned long"](y);
    // actual algorithm code here
}
```

and your function `doStuff` will behave the same as a Web IDL operation declared as

```webidl
void doStuff(boolean x, unsigned long y);
```

## API

This package's main module's default export is an object with a variety of methods, each corresponding to a different Web IDL type. Each method, when invoked on a JavaScript value, will give back the new JavaScript value that results after passing through the Web IDL conversion rules. (See below for more details on what that means.) Alternately, the method could throw an error, if the Web IDL algorithm is specified to do so: for example `conversions["float"](NaN)` [will throw a `TypeError`](http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-float).

Each method also accepts a second, optional, parameter for miscellaneous options. For conversion methods that throw errors, a string option `{ context }` may be provided to provide more information in the error message. (For example, `conversions["float"](NaN, { context: "Argument 1 of Interface's operation" })` will throw an error with message `"Argument 1 of Interface's operation is not a finite floating-point value."`)

If we are dealing with multiple JavaScript realms (such as those created using Node.js' [vm](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) module or the HTML `iframe` element), and exceptions from another realm need to be thrown, one can supply an object option `globals` containing the following properties:

```js
{
  globals: {
    Number,
    String,
    TypeError
  }
}
```

Those specific functions will be used when throwing exceptions.

Specific conversions may also accept other options, the details of which can be found below.

## Conversions implemented

Conversions for all of the basic types from the Web IDL specification are implemented:

- [`any`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-any)
- [`void`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-void)
- [`boolean`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-boolean)
- [Integer types](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-integer-types), which can additionally be provided the boolean options `{ clamp, enforceRange }` as a second parameter
- [`float`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-float), [`unrestricted float`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-unrestricted-float)
- [`double`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-double), [`unrestricted double`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-unrestricted-double)
- [`DOMString`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-DOMString), which can additionally be provided the boolean option `{ treatNullAsEmptyString }` as a second parameter
- [`ByteString`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-ByteString), [`USVString`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-USVString)
- [`object`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-object)
- [Buffer source types](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#es-buffer-source-types), which can additionally be provided with the boolean option `{ allowShared }` as a second parameter

Additionally, for convenience, the following derived type definitions are implemented:

- [`ArrayBufferView`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#ArrayBufferView), which can additionally be provided with the boolean option `{ allowShared }` as a second parameter
- [`BufferSource`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#BufferSource)
- [`DOMTimeStamp`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#DOMTimeStamp)
- [`Function`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#Function)
- [`VoidFunction`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#VoidFunction) (although it will not censor the return type)

Derived types, such as nullable types, promise types, sequences, records, etc. are not handled by this library. You may wish to investigate the [webidl2js](https://github.com/jsdom/webidl2js) project.

### A note on the `long long` types

The `long long` and `unsigned long long` Web IDL types can hold values that cannot be stored in JavaScript numbers. Conversions are still accurate as we make use of BigInt in the conversion process, but in the case of `unsigned long long` we simply cannot represent some possible output values in JavaScript. For example, converting the JavaScript number `-1` to a Web IDL `unsigned long long` is supposed to produce the Web IDL value `18446744073709551615`. Since we are representing our Web IDL values in JavaScript, we can't represent `18446744073709551615`, so we instead the best we could do is `18446744073709551616` as the output.

To mitigate this, we could return the raw BigInt value from the conversion function, but right now it is not implemented. If your use case requires such precision, [file an issue](https://github.com/jsdom/webidl-conversions/issues/new).

On the other hand, `long long` conversion is always accurate, since the i
